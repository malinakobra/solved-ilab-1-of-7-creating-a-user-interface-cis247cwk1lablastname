iLab 1 of 7: Creating a User Interface<strong></strong>

<strong>Scenario and Summary</strong>

This program creates the basic user interface code that can be used in the following week’s iLab assignments. The assignment will help you get started using the programming environment and some practice with coding. You will also be able to reuse much, if not all, of the code in later assignments.

In this program, you will create the following methods:

<strong>DisplayApplicationInformation</strong>, which will provide the program user some basic information about the program. <strong>DisplayDivider</strong>, which will provide a meaningful output separator between different sections of the program output. <strong>GetInput</strong>, which is a generalized function that will prompt the user for a specific type of information, then return the string representation of the user input. <strong>TerminateApplication</strong>, which provides a program termination message and then terminates the application.

Using these methods, you will construct a program that prompts the user for the following:

your name, which will be a string data type; your age, which will be an integer data type; the gas mileage for your car, which will be a double data type; and  a display of the collected information.

Also, note that the program should contain a well-documented program header.

<strong>STEP 1: Review the Design</strong>

Download the program description and puesdocode design, and make sure you fully understand the program design and ask any questions that you may have BEFORE you start programming.

Click Week 1 Lab Design to download program design.

<strong>STEP 2: Construct the Program</strong>

Start Microsoft Visual Studio and create a new project titled “CIS247C_WK1_Lab_LASTNAME”. Using the design, construct the methods. Once the methods are constructed, use the design to create the main program.

<strong>STEP 3: Compile and Test</strong>

When done, ensure that there are no compile errors. If there are errors, open up the Error list and fix all listed errors. Execute your code and check your output to ensure that you have the desired output. If you need to fix anything, close your execution window, modify your code as necessary, and rebuild.

<strong>STEP 4: Screen Prints</strong>

Capture the results of each test and paste them into a Word document. Below is a sample program output.
